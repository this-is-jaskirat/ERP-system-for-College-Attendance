# ERP-system-for-College-Attendance
ERP college attendance system is the one kind of application which integrates all the modules and  functionalities of college system on a single system that can be handled by the administrative head  and access by the students and faculties with valid user id and password.

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) college attendance system is an application which provides a simple interface for maintenance of data of different students, faculties and others information. It integrates all the modules and functionalities of college system on a single system and students and faculties can access by valid user id and password. College ERP System which is automated and centralized. This system have easy user interface and have powerful data management system which makes this system very useful.

The main goal of the entire system is to provide a user friendly interface and powerful data system which make this system more useful. The ERP College attendance system computerizes all the details of the college system which are updated by authorized students and faculty only can access by the students and faculties. Once the details are entered into the system by the authorized person then there is no need for other users to deal with separate section.

Only a person that is having an authorization is enough to maintain all the reports and records of the system. The main thing is that our system reduces the human works at a great effort. It can be helpful such that - Records are always updated. - Manpower is decreased or reduced. - Large amount of data regarding college can be stored. - Accurate and perfect calculations are made. - Maintenance of file is efficient and flexible.

Using Python and Firebase, we have enabled this system to store data on cloud server , so that admin can also remotely access and see the updates in real-time. Common modules used in our program include Numpy , Pandas , Matplotlib ,etc. 

Our college ERP system has all the information about the students, teachers and other respected information. The system allows the admin to add students and faculties. Our system allows a faculty to enter or input student’s attendance into the database which can later be viewed by students and faculties. The students can view his/her attendance through a separate student login.These systems have easy user interface and have powerful data management system which makes this system is very useful.

## Motivation

The purpose is to design software for college database which contains up to date or accurate information of the college. That should improve efficiency and flexibility of college record management and to provide a common and or simple platform for everyone to access the student’s information.

To achieve this, we implement libraries like NumPy and Panda. These libraries are used to read and write on .csv file , which serves as a local database. 

NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy. Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays. It provides a high-performance data manipulation and analysis tool using its powerful data structures. The name Pandas is derived from the word Panel Data – an Econometrics from Multidimensional data.

Using Pandas, we can accomplish five typical steps in the processing and analysis of data, regardless of the origin of data — load, prepare, manipulate, model, and analyze. A CSV is a comma-separated values file, which allows data to be saved in a tabular format. CSVs look like a spreadsheet but with a .csv extension.

CSV files can be used with most any spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets. They differ from other spreadsheet file types because you can only have a single sheet in a file, they can not save cell, column, or row. Also, you cannot not save formulas in this format. Because it’s a plain text file, it can contain only actual text data—in other words, printable ASCII or Unicode characters.

To provide bar-graphs, we use a library called Matplotlib. Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays. It is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. It was introduced by John Hunter in the year 2002.

One of the greatest benefits of visualization is that it allows us visual access to huge amounts of data in easily digestible visuals. Matplotlib consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram etc.

One of the main components of our program is Firebase. Firebase is a mobile- and web application development platform, backed by Google, to help developers deliver richer app experiences. Firebase manages its own infrastructure with a nice set of tools to simplify the workflow of the developer by providing them with development kits and an online dashboard. To access this database we use a module called Pyrebase. Pyrebase is a Python interface to Firebase's REST API and helps our program access the cloud database.
